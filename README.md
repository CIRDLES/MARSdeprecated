MARS
====

Middleware for Assisting the Registration of Samples (MARS) is a project of Working Group 4 of the Internet of Samples  ([iSamples](http://earthcube.org/group/isamples)) NSF-funded Research Coordination Network (RCN).  MARS is being developed to explore the automation of registering legacy samples at [SESAR](http://www.geosamples.org/) (System for Earth Sample Registration) with pertinent metadata and a [IGSN](http://www.geosamples.org/igsnabout) (International GeoSample Number).  The initial targeted repository is the cores collection of [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu).
